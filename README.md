You can DWTFYWT with this code (see
[LICENSE](https://github.com/JetPirate/rubygame/blob/master/LICENSE)
). Also you can write
[me](mailto:fpostoleh@gmail.com)
if
 - you have any question about the game
 - you want to collaborate
 - you have some ideas how to make it better
 - I should remove it from github and never show it again to anyone
even myself

### Usage
After installation:
```sh
$ cd rubygame
$ ./rubygame
```
 - **Enter** to play
 - **WASD** to move
 - **Shift** to speed up
 - **P** to (un)pauze
 - **9** or **0** to control music volume
 - **C** to show controls
 - **ESC** to exit

### Installation

The game uses
[Gosu](https://github.com/gosu/gosu)
as the main library and
[Ruby](https://github.com/ruby/ruby)
as the main language it's written in.

There are two ways to install it:

#### The First one

You just run
[**runme.sh**](https://github.com/JetPirate/rubygame/blob/master/runme.sh)
on your machine and it is done. I _recommend_ to look at it at first because
it will install needed dependencies.

How do I do it:
```sh
$ cd rubygame
$ sh runme.sh
$ ./rubygame
```

**WARNING**
It works only with: Ubuntu, Linux, Fedora. Sure, you could try it anyway,
but I didn't any tests with other OS.

_Windows users_, the script will not work for you, but you could install Gosu
and Ruby by yourselves.
I'll create an .exe file or instruction for Windows users and share it later.

#### The Second one

You just do it by yourselves _until it works_. This is the best way, because it
_guarantees_ you a working game.

**WARNING**
In any case you need to use
[**downloadme.sh**](https://github.com/JetPirate/rubygame/blob/master/downloadme.sh).
It will download the textures and sounds pack the game uses. Again, it's only
needed to get the game work. Of course you can use your own sounds and textures.
You just need to name it just like it is named in the pack.

### Contributing

I'll leave this section here just because everyone does it.
